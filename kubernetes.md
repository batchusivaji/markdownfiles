#                                                KUBERNETES
                                          
### 1) Write a Pod Spec for Spring PetClinic as well as nopCommerce Applications at the same spec EXPOSE ports spc & nop
ANS: first we create k8s pods like spc & nop
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 ```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic
spec:
  containers:
    - name: spc
      image: batchusivaji/raj:1.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    - name: nop
      image: batchusivaji/rajshekar:1.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5000

```
Now we have to apply below commands
  * kubectl apply -f <manifest.yml>
  * kubectl get pods
  * kubectl get pods -o wide
  * kubectl describe pods (podname)

### 2). Write a Pod Spec for Spring PetClinic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod

## K8S ARCHITECTURE

* .Kubernetes is an architecture that offers a loosely coupled mechanism for service discovery across a cluster. A Kubernetes cluster has one or more control planes, and one or more compute nodes.
* .Environments running Kubernetes consist of the following key components:
* .Control plane:It manges the k8s clusters and Workloads and it has componetns like API server,Schedular and control manger
* .API Server:It servers as front end for k8s to communicate with control plane componets and worker nodes and handling external and internal request.
* .Schedular:This component is responsible for scheduling pods on specific nodes according to automated workflows.
* .Control manger:The Kubernetes controller manager is a control loop that monitors and regulates the state of a Kubernetes cluster.
* .etcd:It is component in control plane which stores the data of cluster state and configuration.
* .cloud-controller-manager:This component can embed cloud-specific control logic - for example, it can access the cloud providerâ€™s load balancer service.
Worker nodes:
* .Nodes: Nodes are physical or virtual machines that can run pods as part of a Kubernetes cluster. A cluster can scale up to 5000 nodes.
* .Pods: A pod serves as a single application instance, and is considered the smallest unit in the object model of Kubernetes.
* .kubelet: Each node contains a kubelet, which is a small application that can communicate with the Kubernetes control plane.
* .kube-proxy:It handles all network communications outside and inside the cluster, forwarding traffic or replying on the packet filtering layer of the operating system.

### # Deployments, ReplicaSets and Services

These are all type of controllers. 

****Benefits of Controllers****
- Application reliability: where multiple instances of an application running, prevent problems if one or more instance fails.
- Scaling: when your pods experience a high volume of requests, kubernetes allows you to scale up your pods, allowing for a better user experience. 
- Load balancing: where having multiple versionsof a pod running allow traffic to flow to different pods, and doesnt overload a single pod or node

****Kinds of Controllers****
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments 
- DaemonSets
- Jobs
- Services

## ReplicaSets
Ensures that the specified number of replica for a pod are running at all times.

## Deployments
A deployment controller provides declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets.

- This means you can describe the desired state of a deployment in a YAML file, and the deployment controller will align the actual state to match. 
- Manages a ReplicaSet.

- pod management: running a ReplicaSet allows you to deploy a number of pods, and check their status as a single unit.

- Pause and Resume: pause deployment, make changes, resume deployment. 

## DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that all nodes run a copy of a specific pod.

- As nodes are added and removed from the cluster, a DaemonSet will add or remove the required pods. 

## Jobs 
A supervisor process for pods carrying out batch jobs.

- Jobs are used to run indivual processes that run once and complete successfully. 

## Services
A service allows the communcation between one set of deployments with another. 

- use a service to get pods in two deployments to talk to each other. 

***Kinds of Services***
- Internal: IP is only reachable within the cluster 
- External: endpoint available through node IP: port (called NodePort)
- Load Balancer: Exposes application to the internet with a load balancer (available with a cloud provider)
