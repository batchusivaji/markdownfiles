### Kubenetes
A) activity-1
   1) Write a Pod Spec for Spring PetClinic and nopCommerce Applications

   2) Execute the kubectl commands:
      kubectl get pods and describe pods
B) activity-2
   1) Explain Kubernetes architecture
   2) Setup k8s on single node using minikube and kind
   3) Run the Spring Pet Clinic
c) Please ensure that, all the Classroom K8S Concepts covered so far, have to be practiced well both Technically and Theoretically as well for Interviews perspective like:

* Pods / Containers
* Jobs / CronJobs
* ReplicaSets
* Deployment
* Service / Headless Service
* Volumes / Persistent Volumes / Persistent Volume Claims
* Stateful Sets and
* Namespaces etc.
d).
    Create a MySQL pod with Stateful Set with 1 replica
Create a nopCommerce deployment with 1 replica
Create a Headless Service to interact with nopCommerce with MySQL 
Create a Load Balancer to expose the nopCommerce to External World 
NOTE: 

Try to draw the Architecture Diagram for the above by using Draw.io Tool.

e) * create a instance in terraform and install nopcommerse applicaion
   * create a mysql pod in terraform and mysql database is connected to nopcommerse application 
f) Create a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm
    Deploy any application using kubectl
    Backup Kubernetes I.e backup etcd
    List out all the podâ€™s running in kube system namespace
    Write down all the steps required to make Kubernetes highly available
    Do a rolling update and roll back
    Ensure usage of secret in MySQL and configmaps
    Create a nop commerce deployment with MySQL statefulset and nop  
      deployment
