### 1) Write a Pod Spec for Spring PetClinic as well as nopCommerce Applications at the same spec EXPOSE ports spc & nop
ANS: first we create k8s pods like spc & nop
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 ```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: spring-petclinic
spec:
  containers:
    - name: spc
      image: batchusivaji/raj:1.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
    - name: nop
      image: batchusivaji/rajshekar:1.0
      ports:
        - containerPort: 5000

```
Now we have to apply below commands
  * kubectl apply -f <manifest.yml>
  * kubectl get pods
  * kubectl get pods -o wide
  * kubectl describe pods (podname)

## K8S ARCHITECTURE

* .Kubernetes is an architecture that offers a loosely coupled mechanism for service discovery across a cluster. A Kubernetes cluster has one or more control planes, and one or more compute nodes.
* .Environments running Kubernetes consist of the following key components:
* .Control plane:It manges the k8s clusters and Workloads and it has componetns like API server,Schedular and control manger
* .API Server:It servers as front end for k8s to communicate with control plane componets and worker nodes and handling external and internal request.
* .Schedular:This component is responsible for scheduling pods on specific nodes according to automated workflows.
* .Control manger:The Kubernetes controller manager is a control loop that monitors and regulates the state of a Kubernetes cluster.
* .etcd:It is component in control plane which stores the data of cluster state and configuration.
* .cloud-controller-manager:This component can embed cloud-specific control logic - for example, it can access the cloud providerâ€™s load balancer service.
Worker nodes:
* .Nodes: Nodes are physical or virtual machines that can run pods as part of a Kubernetes cluster. A cluster can scale up to 5000 nodes.
* .Pods: A pod serves as a single application instance, and is considered the smallest unit in the object model of Kubernetes.
* .kubelet: Each node contains a kubelet, which is a small application that can communicate with the Kubernetes control plane.
* .kube-proxy:It handles all network communications outside and inside the cluster, forwarding traffic or replying on the packet filtering layer of the operating system.

```yml
apiversion: apiVersion specifies which version of the Kubernetes API to use to create the object
kind: kind specifies the kind of object defined in this yaml file, here a Service
metadata helps uniquely identify our Service object: we give it a name (myloadbalancer), and a label.
spec: spec specifies the Service. It is of LoadBalancer type. We then go on to specify its ports. We can define many ports if we want but here we just specify the necessary port 8000 for our whoami app. Since 8000 is an HTTP ports: we add a name tag and call it http. targetPort is the port the container welcomes traffic (in our case necessarily 8000), port is the abstracted Service port. For simplicity, we set both as 8000, though we could change port to something else.
selector: selector tells the Service which pods to redirect to: in this case pods with containers running the app we called mydeployment Save and exit the file.
```
## Deployments, ReplicaSets and Services

These are all type of controllers. 

****Benefits of Controllers****
- Application reliability: where multiple instances of an application running, prevent problems if one or more instance fails.
- Scaling: when your pods experience a high volume of requests, kubernetes allows you to scale up your pods, allowing for a better user experience. 
- Load balancing: where having multiple versionsof a pod running allow traffic to flow to different pods, and doesnt overload a single pod or node

****Kinds of Controllers****
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments 
- DaemonSets
- Jobs
- Services

## ReplicaSets
Ensures that the specified number of replica for a pod are running at all times.

## Deployments
A deployment controller provides declarative updates for pods and ReplicaSets.

- This means you can describe the desired state of a deployment in a YAML file, and the deployment controller will align the actual state to match. 
- Manages a ReplicaSet.

- pod management: running a ReplicaSet allows you to deploy a number of pods, and check their status as a single unit.

- Pause and Resume: pause deployment, make changes, resume deployment. 

## DaemonSets
DaemonSets ensure that all nodes run a copy of a specific pod.

- As nodes are added and removed from the cluster, a DaemonSet will add or remove the required pods. 

## Jobs 
A supervisor process for pods carrying out batch jobs.

- Jobs are used to run indivual processes that run once and complete successfully. 

## Services
A service allows the communcation between one set of deployments with another. 

- use a service to get pods in two deployments to talk to each other. 

***Kinds of Services***
- Internal: IP is only reachable within the cluster 
- External: endpoint available through node IP: port (called NodePort)
- Load Balancer: Exposes application to the internet with a load balancer (available with a cloud provider)
###
### Liveness probe:
used to continue checking the availability of a Pod
### Readiness Probe:
used to make sure a Pod is not published as available until the readinessProbe has been able to access it.
### Startup Probe:
 If we define a startup probe for a container, then Kubernetes does not execute the liveness or readiness probes, as long as the container's startup probe does not succeed.
## configure pods:
### initialDelaySeconds:
 Number of seconds after the container has started before liveness or readiness probes are initiated. Defaults to 0 seconds. Minimum value is 0.
### periodSeconds:
 How often (in seconds) to perform the probe. Default to 10 seconds. Minimum value is 1.
### timeoutSeconds:
 Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.
### successThreshold:
 Minimum consecutive successes for the probe to be considered successful after having failed. Defaults to 1. Must be 1 for liveness and startup Probes. Minimum value is 1.
### failureThreshold:
 When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the container. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.

### LoadBalancer :
this Service exposes a set of pods using an external load balancer. All managed Kubernetes offerings have their own implementation of it
![preview](images/k8s-38.png)
![preview](images/loadbalancer.png)
NodePort â€“ the Service exposes a given port on each Node IP in the cluster.
![preview](images/k8s-39.png)
![preview](images/k8s.41.png)
### Ingress:  
NodePort and LoadBalancer let you expose a service by specifying that value in the serviceâ€™s type. Ingress, on the other hand, is a completely independent resource to your service. You declare, create and destroy it separately to your services.

This makes it decoupled and isolated from the services you want to expose. It also helps you to consolidate routing rules into one place.

The one downside is that you need to configure an Ingress Controller for your cluster. But thatâ€™s pretty easyâ€”in this example, weâ€™ll use the Nginx Ingress Controller.
